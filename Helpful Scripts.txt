That particular usage of .on() only binds event handlers to elements that existed when the code was run, 
and won't affect elements that are added dynamically after that code has been executed. 
Instead you'll need to use the event delegation syntax for .on(), something like this:

$(document).on('mouseover', 'ul.ourHolder li', function(){
    $(this).children('div.full').stop().fadeTo('slow',0.5);     
}) 

Ideally you'd replace document with a selector for a more specific, but not dynamically added, 
element that contains all of the elements you want to execute the callback 
function for when they trigger the mouseover event.

Try [short circuit boolean evaluation][1]: `sum += +this.value || 0;`

The `+` tries to box the value to a `Number`, if that fails use value `0`
